概况
Dr. Bo Sun currently is a faculty member in the Institute of Materials Research, Tsinghua SIGS. He was a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering, California Institute of Technology from 2016-2018 with Prof. Austin Minnich. He obtained his PhD from National University of Singapore in Mechanical Engineering in 2016, M.S. in Chemistry and B.S. in Physics, both from Shandong University. 
His research interest is thermal sciences and nanoscale heat transfer. He is an expert on time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), an experimental technique for thermal transport properties. His previous work mainly focused on thermal transport in low dimensional structures such as 2D Black Phosphorus and quasi 1D perovskites, as well as phonon transport mediated by lattice imperfections such as dislocations. He is the first to discover frequency-dependent thermal conductivity in van der Waals crystals and his research on dislocations mediated thermal transport is “a piece of pioneering work in our field”.
He is the 2017 Wang Gungwu Medal nominee in Singapore. He also severs as the reviewer for journals such asPhys. Rev. Lett., Nature Communications, PNAS, ACS Nano etc.

Opening:
Graduate Student Position
Applications are encouraged from students with an excellent educational background in Physics, Materials Science, Thermal Engineering, Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. Interested applicants please contact Dr. Bo Sundirectly to discuss future projects.
