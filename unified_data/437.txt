Biography
As the founder of the Evolving Machine Intelligence (EMI) Group and co-founder of the EvoX Project, I am currently a tenured Associate Professor with the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China. Within the expansive realm of artificial intelligence (AI), my research delves into the intriguing study of how evolution fosters complexity, diversity, and intelligence through computational means. Specifically, my primary research interests lie at the intersection of Evolutionary Computation and pivotal AI domains such as representation learning and reinforcement learning. The ultimate goal is to deliver high-performance computational solutions that address optimization and modeling challenges in contemporary science and engineering.
I am the Founding Chair of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) Shenzhen Chapter. I am serving as an Associated Editor/Editorial Board Member for several journals, including: ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, etc. I am the recipient of the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation Outstanding Paper Awards (2018, 2021), the IEEE CIS Outstanding PhD Dissertation Award (2019), the IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine Outstanding Paper Award (2020). I have been featured as among the World’s Top 2% Scientists (2021 - 2023) and the Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers (2023). I am a Senior Member of IEEE.
