Short Bio
Qi WANG received the B.Eng. degree in information security from Unversity of Science and Technology (USTC) in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2011, supervised by Professor Cunsheng Ding. From October 2011 to September 2013, he was an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg (OvGU), Germany, hosted by Professor Alexander Pott. From October 2013 to September 2014, he was a research associate at HKUST. He has been with the Department of Computer Science and Engieering (CSE), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) since 2014, where he is currently a tenured associate professor.
