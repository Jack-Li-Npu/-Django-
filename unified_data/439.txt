I am a tenured associate professor with the CSE Department of SUSTech. I lead the Software Quality Lab. I am also the director of the Trustworthy Software Research Center of the Research Insititute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems. My research interests mainly include software testing and analysis, empirical software engineering, cyber-physical systems, software security, and trustworthy AI. I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science with honor from Nanjing University in 2010, and my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from HKUST in 2015. Prior to joining SUSTech, I worked at the CASTLE Lab and Cybersecurity Lab of HKUST as a postdoc, under the supervision of Prof. Shing-Chi Cheung and Prof. Charles Zhang.
